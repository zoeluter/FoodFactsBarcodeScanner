# FoodFactsBarcodeScanner

FoodFactsBarcodeScanner is a Python-based command-line tool that uses the Open Food Facts API to fetch and display food product information. The user provides a product barcode, and the application returns the product's name, ingredients, and nutritional information. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run FoodFactsBarcodeScanner on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your command line:

```
python --version
```

Also, this project uses the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:

```
pip install requests
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/FoodFactsBarcodeScanner.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository:
```
cd FoodFactsBarcodeScanner
```

3. Run the Python script:
```
python main.py
```

## Usage

When you run the script, it will prompt you to input a barcode. Enter the barcode of the product you want to know more about and press Enter. The script will then display the product's name, ingredients, and nutritional information. 

Please note that the Open Food Facts database may not include all barcodes. If the script cannot find the barcode you entered, it will notify you accordingly.
